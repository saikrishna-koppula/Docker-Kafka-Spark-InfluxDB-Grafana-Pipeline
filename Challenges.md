## Challenges & Solutions
### 1. Managing High-Throughput Stock Data
**Problem:** Processing rapid stock price updates efficiently.

**Solution:**
- Used Kafka partitions to distribute the load.
- Tuned Spark micro-batch intervals for low-latency processing.
- Configured InfluxDB retention policies for efficient data management.

**Outcome:** Achieved low-latency stock data processing with a high ingestion rate.

### 2. Handling Failures and Fault Tolerance
**Problem:** System failures could lead to missing financial transactions.

**Solution:**
- Enabled Kafka message retention to replay stock market data if needed.
- Configured checkpointing in Spark Streaming for fault tolerance.

**Outcome:** Ensured resilience and accurate financial data processing.

### 3. Efficient Time-Series Storage
**Problem:** High-frequency stock price updates required optimized storage for fast retrieval.

**Solution:**
- Used InfluxDB’s continuous queries to pre-aggregate stock data (e.g., moving averages).
- Optimized tagging strategy to improve query performance for different stock symbols.

**Outcome:** Reduced query latency

### 4. Accurate Timestamp Conversion
**Problem:** Stock data contained timestamps in different formats, causing inconsistencies.

**Solution:**
- Standardized timestamps across all components.
- Used Spark’s built-in functions to parse and convert timestamps accurately.

**Outcome:** Ensured consistency in time-based stock analytics.

### 5. Optimized Query Performance for Dashboards
**Problem:** Queries needed to extract minimal data while maintaining dashboard accuracy.

**Solution:**
- Defined logical filters to fetch only the necessary data.
- Used InfluxDB’s downsampling features to pre-aggregate stock metrics.

**Outcome:** Reduced dashboard query load and improved response times.

### 6. Workarounds for Grafana Limitations
**Problem:** Grafana had constraints in certain visualizations and query optimizations.

**Solution:**
- Used custom queries to overcome dashboard limitations.
- Applied transformations within InfluxDB before visualization.

**Outcome:** Achieved a more comprehensive and accurate dashboard display.
